# 🧠 How to Form a Clear Question or Hypothesis

A strong data science project starts with a clear, focused question or hypothesis. Use this template to guide your thinking as you begin exploring your dataset.

---

## ✅ What Makes a Good Question?

- 🎯 **Specific** – Focus on a measurable outcome or variable.
- 📊 **Data-Driven** – Can be answered using your chosen dataset.
- 💡 **Insightful** – Leads to meaningful interpretation or action.
- 🎓 **Thematically Aligned** – Connects to either **Violence & Conflict** or **Environmental Issues**.

## 📄 Template

### 🔹 Project Theme:
`[Violence or Environment]`

### 🔹 Dataset Chosen:
`[Name of dataset + data source]`

### 🔹 Main Question:
> _What are you trying to understand, measure, or predict? Frame it as a question._  
>  
> Example formats:
> - How does **[factor A]** affect **[outcome B]** in **[region/timeframe]**?
> - What are the trends in **[metric]** over **[time or geography]**?
> - Can we predict **[event/outcome]** based on **[features]**?

### 🔹 Hypothesis (Optional but Encouraged):
> _Form a testable statement that reflects your expectations based on logic or prior research._  
>  
> Example formats:
> - We hypothesize that **[variable A]** is positively correlated with **[variable B]**.
> - **[Condition or policy]** will reduce/increase **[measurable outcome]**.
> - **[Location A]** will have higher/lower **[metric]** than **[Location B]** due to **[reason]**.

### 🔹 Why This Matters:
> _Explain the significance of your question. What impact could the findings have?_  
>  
> Example: "Understanding protest patterns in post-election periods can inform peacekeeping strategies."

## 🧪 Example 1 — Theme: Violence

- **Theme:** Violence  
- **Dataset:** ACLED – Conflict Event Data  
- **Question:** How has protest-related violence in Colombia evolved from 2016 to 2024?  
- **Hypothesis:** We hypothesize that protest events have become more frequent but less deadly over time.  
- **Why It Matters:** Insight into protest trends can inform peacekeeping and policy decisions in post-conflict settings.

## 🌱 Example 2 — Theme: Environment

- **Theme:** Environment  
- **Dataset:** WHO PM2.5 Air Quality  
- **Question:** What is the relationship between air quality and public transportation usage across major cities?  
- **Hypothesis:** We expect cities with higher public transit usage to have lower PM2.5 pollution levels.  
- **Why It Matters:** Identifying effective pollution-reduction strategies is critical for urban planning and public health.
