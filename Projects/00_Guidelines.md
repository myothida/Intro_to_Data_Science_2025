# Final Project Guidelines

Your final project is a team-based, end-to-end data science project that brings together everything you've learned in this course. You'll select a theme, analyze a real dataset, and present your findings as a cohesive, data-driven story.

---

## Project Goals

- Apply core data science techniques to a real-world problem
- Conduct EDA and build basic predictive models
- Tell a compelling, insightful narrative through data
- Practice collaboration, documentation, and public presentation

---
## Choose a Theme

All projects must align with one of the following themes:
- Violence & Conflict
- Environmental Issues

---

## Timeline & Milestones

### Week 7: Final Project Development
- Form teams of 3–5 members
- Begin your project work:
  - Form Project question or hypotheis. See example here: [`01_QuestionForming.md`](01_QuestionsForming.md)
  - Select one of the dataset from [`02_datasets.md`](02_datasets.md)
  - Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
  - Build and evaluate a machine learning model (if applicable)
  - Create charts, maps, and other visualizations
  - Write key findings and data narrative
  - Draft presentation slides and summary report


### Week 8: Final Project Showcase
- Present your project (10 minutes per team)
- Participate in live Q&A with classmates
- Receive instructor feedback
- Reflect on what you learned and what you'd improve
- Discuss how to use this project in portfolios/resumes

- Create a folder named `<Team_Name>` inside the `Projects/` directory
- Submit the following in your team folder:
   - [ ] `final_notebook.ipynb`: Cleaned, well-commented notebook with code, EDA, and model
   - [ ] `final_presentation.pdf` or `.pptx`: Slides used in your presentation
   - [ ] `README.md`: Brief overview of your project, dataset, and findings
   - [ ] `data/`: Folder with original or cleaned dataset (CSV preferred)
   - [ ] `team_contribtuions.md`: who did what
   - [ ] `team_reflections.md`: What worked, what didn’t, what you learned
